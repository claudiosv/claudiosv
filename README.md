:man_technologist: &nbsp; **Experience**

* **Research Scientist Intern** at *IBM Research*
  * Developed AutoPDL, a source-to-source optimizer for Prompt Declaration Language (PDL) that automatically searches and optimizes prompt programs over user-defined spaces.
  * Implemented a library of agentic reasoning patterns (ReAct, ReWOO) and conducted empirical evaluation across 7 LLMs and multiple benchmarks, achieving +9 pp average accuracy over baselines. Published AutoML'25 (1st author).
* **Graduate Student Researcher** at *UC Davis*
  * Investigated confidence vs correctness (calibration) of LLMs for code eg GPT3.5 in program synthesis, line completion, and defect detection tasks. Built dataset of Python functions for prompting & evaluating model completions. Published ICSE'25 (1st author).
  * Designed and trained custom HuggingFace/PyTorch BERT model for embedding dynamic analysis artifacts for source code retrieval using FAISS and evaluated performance. Built dataset of open source projects under instrumentation. MS Thesis. Published FSE'23 SRC (1st author).
  * Teaching: ECS 160 Software Engineering, ECS 171 Machine Learning: Held discussion section & office hours, produced & graded homework, proctored & graded exam, answered student questions on discussion forum
* **Machine Learning Intern** at *Overstock*
  * Built & deployed app to analyze product embedding spaces using nearest neighbor visualizations, linear & classification probes, and catalog coverage analysis for recommender systems ML team, optimizing their development and debugging workflow.
* **Software Engineer** at *Floryn BV*
  * Developed systems to monitor and interpret ML model outputs, giving critical decision insights to technical & non-technical stakeholders e.g. through the use of SHAP.
