:man_technologist: &nbsp; **Experience**

* **Research Scientist Intern** at *IBM Research*
  * Researched language model programming and automated prompt program optimization, resulting in AutoPDL system. Published AutoML'25 (1st author).
* **Graduate Student Researcher** at *UC Davis*
  * Investigated confidence vs correctness (calibration) of LLMs for code eg GPT3.5 in program synthesis, line completion, and defect detection tasks. Built dataset of Python functions for prompting & evaluating model completions. Published ICSE'25 (1st author).
  * Designed and trained custom HuggingFace/PyTorch BERT model for embedding dynamic analysis artifacts for source code retrieval using FAISS and evaluated performance. Built dataset of open source projects under instrumentation. MS Thesis. Published FSE'23 SRC (1st author).
  * Teaching: ECS 160 Software Engineering, ECS 171 Machine Learning: Held discussion section & office hours, produced & graded homework, proctored & graded exam, answered student questions on discussion forum
* **Machine Learning Intern** at *Overstock*
  * Built & deployed Streamlit app to analyze embedding spaces used in product recommender systems.
  * Designed & implemented 3 core features: nearest neighbor visualizations, linear & classification probes, and catalog coverage analysis for recommender systems ML team, optimizing their development and debugging workflow.
  * Reduced time to evaluate product embeddings from approx. 1 day to 10 minutes, increasing engineering productivity
* **Junior Software Engineer** at *Floryn BV*
  * Created system for monitoring ML model outputs & explaining decisions to non-technical stakeholders e.g. through the use of SHAP.
  * Developed features & improvements on Ruby on Rails and React/TypeScript apps that managed over â‚¬185 million euros in outgoing loans at one of the Netherland's fastest growing startups with over â‚¬78 million in funding
